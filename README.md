# [Shellsort sorting algorithm](https://github.com/rubenhed/C/tree/main/Shellsort_sorting_algorithm)
* Sorting algorithm to sort lists, optimized using multi-threading and optimization flags.
* University project built in C
* Main libraries used: OpenMP, stdio, stdlib.

# [Movie Database](https://github.com/rubenhed/Java/tree/main/Movie_Database)
* A local database that lets the user add and score new movies, and search for movies based on name and score. 
* University project built in Java
